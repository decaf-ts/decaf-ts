## Decaf
#### **is almost a framework**

# Introduction

Decaf, as an `almost` framework, was designed to seamlessly bridge backend model definitions with frontend ones.

This is a common issue in the current web development landscape.

Originally meant as an ORM solution for a specific blockchain framework, its versatility as an ORM
(when no properly supported solution is available) has been demonstrated in several internal projects.

It's later extension as a model rendering tool, ensuring UI for CRUD and List screens and list elements, 
easily supporting custom validations has also proven a game changer in our frontend development workflow.

The ability to imbue business logic in the model definition itself also translates to Self Sovereign Data as 
also previously demonstrated.
